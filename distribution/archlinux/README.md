# ArchLinux Packaging Files

This folder contains three variants of `PKGBUILD`'s.

- `stable` contains the PKGBUILD used on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libva-intel-driver-irql).

- `lib32` contains a PKGBUILD for 32-bit environments, intended only for Steam.

- `git` contains the PKGBUILD used to build directly from the master branch.
