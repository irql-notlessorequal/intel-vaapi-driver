# Security Policy

As this is a community fork that is controlled by one person, I wish to keep the driver mainly safe even if it's old C code that would probably give any code analysis tool a seizure.

If you discover a vulnerability and wish to inform me through confidential means, please open an issue requesting for a direct line of communication.

I will be more than happy to provide various means.
